### pull requests

What is a pull request?: Collaboration happens on a pull request. The pull request shows the changes in your branch to other people and allows people to accept, reject, or suggest additional changes to your branch. In a side by side comparison, this pull request is going to keep the changes you just made on your branch and propose applying them to the main project branch. For more information about pull requests, see "About pull requests".

### merging conflicts

Welcome to "Managing Merge Conflicts"! ðŸ‘‹

What is a merge conflict?: A merge conflict occurs when changes are made to the same part of the same file on two different branches. You usually find out about conflicts in a pull request so let's start by creating one.

### Resolve merge conflicts



### Step 2: Resolve a merge conflict

_Good start! Now let's look deeper at a merge conflict! :mag:_

This can be intimidating, but have no fear, Git is smart when it comes to merging! Git only needs a human to decide how to [resolve the conflict](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/addressing-merge-conflicts/resolving-a-merge-conflict-using-the-command-line). Sometimes, the best way to resolve a merge conflict is to add content that's from both branches, or even something that isn't on either! This is why Git needs a human to look at the code and make the proper fixes.

### :keyboard: Activity: Resolve a merge conflict

1. At the bottom of the page, under "This branch has conflicts that must be resolved", click the **Resolve conflicts** button.
1. Look for the highlighted sections that begins with `<<<<<<< my-resume` and ends with `>>>>>>> main`. These markers are added by Git to show you the content that is in conflict.
1. Remove the changes made on the main branch by deleting all of the content below the `=======` and above `>>>>>>> main`.
1. Next, remove the merge conflict markers by deleting the following lines:
   ```
   <<<<<<< my-resume
   =======
   >>>>>>> main
   ```
1. With the merge conflict markers removed, click **Mark as resolved**.
1. Finally, click **Commit merge**.

esolving a conflict doesn't automatically merge the pull request in GitHub. Instead, it stores the resolution of the conflict in a merge commit and allows you and your team to keep working. To resolve a conflict, GitHub performs what is known as a _reverse merge_. This means that the changes from the `main` branch were merged into your `my-resume` branch. With a reverse merge, only the `my-resume` branch is updated. This allows you to test the resolved changes on your branch before you merge it into `main`.
